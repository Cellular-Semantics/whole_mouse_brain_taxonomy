| Name | Description | Annotation Method | Rank |
|------|-------------|-------------------|------|
|neurotransmitter|Clusters are assigned based on the average expression of both neurotransmitter transporter genes and key neurotransmitter synthesizing enzyme genes.||None|
|class|The top level of cell type definition in the mouse whole brain taxonomy. It is primarily determined by broad brain region and neurotransmitter type. All cells within a subclass belong to the same class. Class provides a broader categorization of cell types.||3|
|subclass|The coarse level of cell type definition in the mouse whole brain taxonomy. All cells within a supertype belong to the same subclass. Subclass groups together related supertypes.||2|
|supertype|The second finest level of cell type definition in the mouse whole brain taxonomy. All cells within a cluster belong to the same supertype. Supertype groups together similar clusters.||1|
|cluster|The finest level of cell type definition in the mouse whole brain taxonomy. Cells within a cluster share similar characteristics and belong to the same supertype.||0|
